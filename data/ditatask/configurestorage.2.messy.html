<h1>Configuring hard storage devices</h1>
<p>Most hard disks do not need any configuring. If they do, the instructions are relatively
    simple.</p>
First check the documentation that came with your storage device. If the device requires configuring,
      follow the steps below.
<ol><li>If your system recognizes the device, it may be able to configure it without help. If so, do not try and
          stop it.</li><li>Otherwise, your drive should come with software. Use this software to format and partition your
          drive.</li><li>Once your drive is configured, restart the system. Just for fun. But be sure to remove any vendor software
          from your system before doing so.</li></ol>
