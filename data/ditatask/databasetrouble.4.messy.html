<h1>Troubleshooting a database</h1>
<p>Databases rarely have problems, but this may be helpful if you find some.</p>
<ul><li>If performance is slow, try removing several thousand records.</li><li>If none of your commands work, make sure they are SQL commands and not SEQUEL commands.</li><li>If you cannot get anything to work at all, try uninstalling and reinstalling.</li><li>For more detailed troubleshooting help, see the online documentation shipped with your database.</li></ul>
