PDF plug-in structure
=====================

    In cases that require substantial customizations, it is often 
    useful to organize the files in a folder structure that mimics
    the hierarchy of the default PDF plug-in. This method facilitates
    comparisons with the default settings in the base PDF plug-in and
    makes it easier to migrate customizations to new toolkit versions.

To begin creating a new custom plug-in, you can copy the plugins/org.dita.pdf2/Customization
folder to a new folder, such as plugins/com.company.pdf
