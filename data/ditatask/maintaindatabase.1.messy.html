<h1>Maintaining a database</h1>
<p>Maintaining a database does not take much work.</p>
<ul><li>If the database crashes, restart it.</li><li>If the database is slow, tell people not to put so much in it.</li><li>Try to limit the number of records in your database. Too many records leads to confusion.</li></ul>
