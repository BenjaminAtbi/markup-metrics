  <title>PDF plug-in structure</title>
  <body>
    <p>In cases that require substantial customizations, it is often useful to organize the files in a folder
        structure that mimics the hierarchy of the default PDF plug-in. This method facilitates comparisons with the default
        settings in the base PDF plug-in and makes it easier to migrate customizations to new toolkit versions.</p>    
        <p>To begin creating a new custom plug-in, you can copy the <code>plugins/org.dita.pdf2/Customization</code>
      folder to a new folder, such as <code>plugins/com.company.pdf</code>.</p>
